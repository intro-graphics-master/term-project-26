# CS 174A Final Project

UCLA CS174A Spring 2019 Final Project

Our project was inspired by the ending of Avengers: Infinity Wars. With the click of the snap button, the player can cause our spiderman model to disintegrate.

Team Members: Ryan Miyahara, Bradley Nishida, and Jordan Uyeki

The spiderman model was created using a 3D array structure so that each part of the model could be referenced for the disintegration effect to take place. The entire scene is encompassed in a cube, to give a skybox effect.

ADVANCED TOPICS: Particle Effect: We were inspired by particle effects and tried to implement our own version of this through the use of a 3d array structure to build the model and then random sinusoidal movement and eventual disappearance of each individual component of the model to imitate particle effects.
*NOTE: We initially tried doing the disintegration by developing a custom shader, which we were hoping to apply to the entire model, which we planned to hierarchially build.

CONTRIBUTIONS: Ryan and Bradley worked on animation. Bradley and Jordan worked on the spiderman model. Jordan worked on the scene.
